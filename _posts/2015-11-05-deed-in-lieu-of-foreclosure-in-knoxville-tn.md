title: Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure in Knoxville Tn
---

### Another option for stopping your foreclosure is a Deed In Lieu Of Foreclosure.&nbsp;

The Deed-in-Lieu of Foreclosure allows a mortgagor in default, who does not qualify for any other HUD Loss Mitigation option, to sign the house back over to the mortgage company. A homeowner is sometimes better off signing a deed-in-lieu rather than letting the lender start foreclosure proceedings.&nbsp;

That’s because with the signing of a deed-in-lieu the borrower is voluntarily giving the home back to the bank. Although the loan default would be entered on your credit record it may not do the damage that a full foreclosure would. Foreclosures usually stay on your credit file for at least 7 years. You can also avoid the time and stress involved in fighting a foreclosure battle that the lender is sure to win.

The lender (the mortgage servicer) can pay, not to exceed $2,000 compensation, to the mortgagor (you, the homeowner), however the $2,000 compensation is not paid to you until you have vacated the property.

Any compensation must be applied to any junior lien(s) placed on the mortgaged property.&nbsp;

A deed-in-lieu can only be done when you have one mortgage on the property. If you have a first and second mortgage, you cannot do a deed-in-lieu.
