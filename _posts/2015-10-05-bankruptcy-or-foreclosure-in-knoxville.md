title: Bankruptcy or Foreclosure in Knoxville
---
In this blog I will talk about the option of filing for bankruptcy.Bankruptcy is a temporary solution and should always be a last resort option.

### Knoxville, TN Real estate owners and homeowners who have waited too long to deal with foreclosure often find out that there is little that can be done to help them by bankruptcy lawyers.

The law still permits individuals to file their own bankruptcy petition on a pro-se basis (representing themselves). Unrepresented individuals should NEVER file Chapter 7 bankruptcy without the assistance of a competent attorney.

Most homeowners have the possibility of filing two different types of Bankruptcy, a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy which is merely a reorganization of the debts, and a Chapter 7 which is a discharge of the debts. Bankruptcies can usually only prolong the situation. In rare instances, a homeowner may be able to successfully use a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy as a way of restructuring all of their other debts where they can then free up enough cash in order to make their payments, such as their house payment. Less than 10% of all people who file a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy ever successfully make it through to the end of the Bankruptcy.

### In instances where a Knoxville homeowner knows that they will be unable to make their mortgage payments because their financial situation has changed for the worse, they would be wise to wait to file a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy until the foreclosure process has concluded.
