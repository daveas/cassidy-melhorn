## If you haven't considered a forbearance to remedy missed house payments, here's why you should.

Forbearance is a formal, written agreement between you and the bank to reduce or suspend monthly payments for a specific period of time. This means that for a period of time, you would either pay only a portion of your regular mortgage payment or not make any payments at all. 

At the end of the agreed-upon period, you would be required to resume regular monthly payments as well as pay additional funds to make up for the past due amount. During the time that the payments are either suspended or reduced, you would have the opportunity to resolve the financial hardship you're facing.  

This agreement leads to reinstatement of the loan. There is no maximum duration, but the maximum arrearage due may not exceed 12 months arrearage of principal, interest, taxes and insurance.
