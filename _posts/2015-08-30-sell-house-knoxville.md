## Searching "Sell house Knoxville"? You have options here!

If you're thinking of selling, the option of selling to a cash buyer is a good one.  

If the property is worth more than the amount owed on your mortgage, a quick sale to a cash buyer can help you avoid the foreclosure and all the hassle involved with a foreclosure. 

### Cash buyers are usually real estate investors who will buy your house in an "as is" condition, and you can sometimes negotiate a move out date with such a buyer, giving you time to find a new home.

The foreclosure is halted as soon as the title is transferred, which means your credit score will not be as badly affected. This is really only an option if you have equity available in the property.

### In the meantime, if I can help you to sell your house quickly, please give me a call. I'm an active real estate investor currently looking for properties in your area.  I can make an all cash fair market offer and close quickly.

If there's anything I can do to assist you please don't hesitate to call my office at: 865-321-8999 or email me at: volhomes1@gmail.com

Sincerely,
Cassidy
