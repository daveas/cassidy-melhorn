## A Short Sale Could Be Just What You're Looking For

A short sale is when a bank or mortgage lender agrees to discount a loan balance due to an economic or financial hardship on the part of the borrower (you). 

This negotiation is all done through communication with the lender's loss mitigation department. You sell your property for less than the outstanding balance of the loan, and turn over the proceeds of the sale to the lender in full satisfaction of your debt. The lender has the right to approve or disapprove of a proposed sale.

### A short sale typically is executed to prevent a home foreclosure. Often a bank will choose to allow a short sale if they believe that it will result in a smaller financial loss than foreclosing. For the home owner, the advantages include avoidance of having a foreclosure on their credit history and the partial control of the monetary deficiency.

Certain conditions must be satisfied in order to qualify for a short sale. The property must be owner-occupied, the mortgagor must be 31 days delinquent in or more at the time of the pre-foreclosure sale closing, and the mortgagor must provide documentation of a reduction in income or an increase in living expense, and documentation that verifies that the mortgagors need to vacate the property.
