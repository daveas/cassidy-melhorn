## Reinstatement by bringing the loan current
You Have Options With Your House
Important things you need to know
Thanks for visiting our blog on "The 5 Fastest Ways To ### Stop Foreclosure in 48 Hours Or Less"

In the first chapter of the report we talk about ### stopping the foreclosure process by bringing the loan current, also
referred to as a reinstatement.

Reinstatement occurs when the loan is brought current by paying the total amount past due. You have an absolute right to fully reinstate you loan within 90 days of being served with a Notice of Default. 

If you are now able to make your mortgage payments or your income has returned to its former level, you can negotiate with the bank or lender to bring your loan current by paying off any arrearage. The servicer may be able to arrange an increase in monthly payments until the loan is brought current. This means that each month you would add an additional amount of money (determined by the bank) to your regular monthly payment until the amount that was overdue has been repaid.

If you can show the bank that you are able to resume making payments, and that you can make up the past due balance by either a lump sum or over a short period of time (12 to 24 months), then you can reinstate your mortgage and keep your home.
